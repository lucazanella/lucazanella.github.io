Hi! I am Luca, a PhD Student at the <a href="https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/">Multimedia and 
Human Understanding Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.disi.unitn.it/">Department of 
Information Engineering and Computer Science</a> of University of Trento, Italy, where I 
am supervised by Prof. <a href="https://eliricci.eu/">Elisa Ricci</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of vision and language models for analyzing 
and understanding complex video scenes.
